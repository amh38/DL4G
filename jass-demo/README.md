Demo for using the jass-kit library.

The demo contains a sample player for hearts and jass and two main files for trying them out in a arena.

The demo uses the jass-kit which must be installed.

There is also a tool to convert log files into comma separated values (csv) files in order to generate training data for machine learning later. More tools might be added during the course.
